<h1>The Best Movies According to Silvester</h1>

    <h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>

<hr>

        <h3>Top Gun: Maverick</h3>

        <p>I love this movie because the movie highlights the bravery of our aviators 
        and sailors at sea. It is indeed a love letter to aviation. 
        </p>

        <p>Although this film does offer plenty of style, it's pretty clear that the creators
         chose substance over style, focusing on strong<br /> characters, compelling writing, and excellent direction, rather than formulaic presentations or mimicry.</p>

        <h3>Tears of the Sun</h3>

        <p>This is a very heroic film dedicated to soldiers. Giving importance to the lives of fellowmen who are in need  especially<br /> those who are in the hands of bad people.</p>

        <p>“It's a movie about humanity, finding that human side in all of us in the middle of conflict,” star Bruce Willis (Waters) says. “Waters <br /> embarks not only on a physical journey, but also on a soulful journey. You see him transformed by the compassion he feels for these <br /> refugees and their plight.</p>

        <h3>Olympus Has Fallen</h3>

        <p>This is a very action-packed movie of Gerard Butler
        It happens to be that he is my favorite action star.
        </p>

        <p>While "Olympus Has Fallen" breaks no major new ground in the political thriller genre, Fuqua has directed a sharp, very taut adventure <br /> that keeps you engrossed from start to finish. It delivers some excellent visuals and a few surprising twists that add beautifully to the suspense.</p>
