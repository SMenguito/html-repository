<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Silvester Menguito, single, 36 years old. I am a Registered Electrical Engineer here in the Philippines. I am currently
   residing at Purok 1 Brgy. San Isidro, Babak District, Island Garden City of Samal 8119, Davao del Norte, Philippines. I 
   finished college with a Bachelor's Degree in Electrical Engineering at the University of Southeastern Philippines Obrero, 
   Davao City Campus on April 2009. I passed the Board Examinations for Registered Electrical Engineers on September 2009 with a
    74.05 % passing rate.</p>

<p>My latest job position related to Electrical Engineering was in a 2 x 150 MegaWatt Coal-Fired Thermal Power Station here in Davao
  City, Philippines as a Control Room Engineer (December 2015 - April 2021) which lasted for five years. 
  Now, I am currently a freelancer working for Telus International AI Inc. as a part-time Online Maps Quality Analyst since July 
  2021 and at the same time taking the opportunity of learning to study on Web Development.

<p>I am very fond of exploring anything about electricity. In fact, I did have some DIY projects done in home like drones, backup power
  supplies and battery banks. I am now planning to have my DIY solar system just for my household use if time would allow. I also 
  like music. I do find some available time to play my guitar and practice some of my favorite piece. And of course, what I really 
  want to do and spend most of my time is Web Development. It is a very exciting craft and sort of addicting too!
